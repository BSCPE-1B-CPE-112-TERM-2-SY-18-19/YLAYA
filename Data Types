Data types and visibility




Outline



• Data types

• Type conversion

• Visibility



Data types



• A data type specifies:

– The set of values that data of that type can have

(e.g. integer, real, character, Boolean, colour,

Greek letter, city, etc.)



– The type of operations that can be performed

with the data. For example, two integer numbers

can be added, the population of a city can be

calculated, etc.



Basic data types in C++ (int)



• Integer (int). Represent the set of integer

numbers.



– In practice, computers have a limitation representing

integer numbers.

– For a 32-bit machine, int can represent the numbers

in the interval [-(231-1), 231-1].[-2147483648, 2147483647]

– Arithmetic operators: +, -,

?, /, %

Integer division and remainder: 13 / 3 = 4, 13 % 3 = 1



Basic data types in C++ (double)

• Real (double). Represent the set of real numbers.

– In practice, computers can only represent real

numbers in a certain interval and with a certain

accuracy.

– IEEE 754-1985 standard, double-precision 64 bit:

• Numbers closest to zero: ±5 × 10?324

• Numbers furthest from zero: ±1.7976931348623157 × 10308

• Special representations for 0, +? and -?

Real division: 13.0 / 4.0 = 3.25



Basic data types in C++ (bool)

• Boolean (bool). Represent logic values.

– Values: false and true

– Operators: not, and, or.

x not x

false true

true false

x y x and y

false false false

false true false

true false false

true true true

x y x or y

false false false

false true true

true false true

true true true

Basic data types in C++ (bool)

• Properties of Boolean algebra

– Commutativity:

• a and b = b and a

• a or b = b or a

– Associativity:

• (a and b) and c = a and (b and c)

• (a or b) or c = a or (b or c)

– Distributivity:

• a and (b or c) = (a and b) or (a and c)

• a or (b and c) = (a or b) and (a or c)

– Double negation:

• not (not a) = a

– De Morgan’s law:

• not (a and b) = (not a) or (not b)

• not (a or b) = (not a) and (not b)

Basic data types in C++ (char)

• Character (char). Represent letters, digits, punctuation

marks and control characters.

• Every character is represented by a code (integer number).

There are various standard codes:

– American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII)

– Unicode (wider than ASCII)

• Some characters are grouped by families (uppercase letters,

lowercase letters and digits). Characters in a family have

consecutive codes: 'a'…'z', 'A'…'Z', '0'…'9'

• Operators: given the integer encoding, arithmetic operators

can be used, even though only addition and subtraction

make sense, e.g. 'C'+1='D', 'm'+4='q', 'G'-1='F'.



Basic data types in C++ (char)



Basic data types in C++ (string)

• Strings (string). Represent sequences of

characters.

• Examples

– "Hello, world!", "This is a string", ":-)", "3.1416"

– "" is the empty string (no characters)

– 'A' is a character, "A" is a string

• Note: use #include <string> in the header of a

Relational operators

• The values of most data types can be compared using

relational operators:

== != > >= < <=

• Relational operators return a Boolean value (true or false)

• Examples

– 5 == 5 is true, 5 == 6 is false, 5 != 6 is true

– 3.1416 <= 7 is true, -5.99 >= 0.1 is false

– 'J' <= 'K' is true, 'a' == 'A' is false

– "Obama" == "Bush" is false, "Bush" == "Bush" is true,

"Bush" < "Obama" is true, "book" < "booking" is true

(relational operators use lexicographical order in strings)

Variable declarations

• A variable is declared as:

type variable_name;

• Examples

int population;

double distance;

string my_name;

• Several variables can be declared together:

int age, children, cars;

• After its declaration, the value of a variable is

undefined (unknown).

Expressions

• Expression: a combination of literals,

variables, operators and functions that is

evaluated and returns a value

• Examples:

a + 3?(i - 1) ? int

sqrt(x)?log(4?n) ? double

(i - 3) <= x ? bool

(a != b) and (s <= "abc") ? bool

Expressions

• The operands used in expressions must be

consistent with the operators.

int a, b, n;

…

(a <= b) + n (Incorrect expression:

semantic error)

bool int

cannot add bool to int

Expressions

• Operators in expressions are evaluated according

to certain rules of precedence

• Example: 3 + 4?5 != (3 + 4)?5

• Use parenthesis to change the precedence or

when you are not sure about it.

TYPE CONVERSION

Introduction to Programming © Dept. CS, UPC 16

Type conversion

• Consider the following code:

int i = 5;

char a = ‘B’;

double x = 1.5;

i = i + x;

if (i) x = 5?a;

Type conversion

• In many programming languages, the compiler would

report several type errors. Possibly:

int i = 5;

char a = ‘B’;

double x = 1.5;

i = i + x;

if (i) x = 5?a;

Introduction to Programming © Dept. CS, UPC 18

Type conversion

• In C++, there would be no errors in this fragment of

code:

int i = 5;

char a = ‘B’;

double x = 1.5;

i = i + x; // i gets the value 6

if (i) x = 5?a;

// the condition of the if statement

// would be true and x would get 5

// multiplied by the code of ‘B’

// converted into double

Type conversion

• As a general rule, using implicit type conversions is

not considered to be a good practice because:

– The code is less readable.

– The code is less reliable, since unintentional errors may be

introduced and they may be difficult to debug.

• Recommendation: to operate with different types, use

explicit type conversions

char(i), int(‘a’), double(i)

• Never use statements that depend on a particular encoding:

– Wrong: c == 65, c == char(65), int(c) == 65

– Correct: c == ‘A’

• Arithmetic operations between integer and real values

usually imply an implicit conversion into real values.

• Be careful:

int i=3, j=2;

double x;

x = i/j; // x = 1.0

x = i/double(j); // x = 1.5

x = double(i)/j; // x = 1.5

x = double(i/j); // x = 1.0

x = i/2; // x = 1.0

x = i/2.0; // x = 1.5



VISIBILITY

Visibility of variables

• Variables are only visible after their

declaration and in the block they have been

declared.

• Blocks can include other blocks. The variables

of the outer blocks are visible, a priori, in the

inner blocks.

• A variable declared in an inner block masks

the variables with the same name declared in

outer blocks.



Visibility of variables

{

// a and b are not visible

int a = 1, b = 20;

// a and b are visible

cout << a; // writes 1

{

// c is not visible, a and b are visible

cout << a + b; // writes 21

int b = 3, c = 4;

// b and c are visible,

// but the outer b is not visible

cout << b; // writes 3

cout << c; // writes 4

}

// c is not visible

cout << b; // writes 20

}
